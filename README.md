## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Local Development

To get PySkills Web running on your local machine for development and testing, please follow these comprehensive instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meez-111/pyskills-web.git
cd pyskills-web
```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and prevent conflicts with other Python projects.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Run the Flask Application

Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to point to your main application file (`app.py`), and then run the Flask development server:

```bash
# On Windows Command Prompt:
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

# On PowerShell (Windows):
$env:FLASK_APP="app.py"
flask run

# On macOS/Linux:
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

Alternatively, the `app.py` contains `if __name__ == '__main__': app.run()`, you can simply run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## üöÄ How to Use

Once the Flask development server is running, you can interact with the PySkills Web application through your web browser.

### Access the Application

Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the local server address, typically:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Explore the Interface

## üìà Future Enhancements

  * **Database Integration**: Implement a robust database solution (e.g., SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL or SQLite) for persistent data storage and complex data management.
  * **User Authentication & Authorization**: Develop a secure user login/registration system with session management and role-based access control.
  * **Advanced Frontend Interactivity**: Integrate a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, or Svelte) for more complex client-side functionalities, dynamic content updates, and a richer user experience.
  * **API Development**: Expand the backend with a comprehensive RESTful API to support potential mobile applications or external service integrations.
  * **Comprehensive Testing**: Implement unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like `pytest` to ensure application stability, reliability, and maintainability.
  * **Deployment**: Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run) for public accessibility and continuous integration/delivery.
